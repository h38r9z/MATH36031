MATH36031 Project 3 - deadline 13th December 2024, time 1100hrs.For this project you need will need   to   download   the   bananas.   csv   ﬁle   on   Blackboard,   and   it   will located in the Projects folder in the Project 3 section.   This is a very large dataﬁle with   more than   13000 entries, so do not try to print the   ﬁle!   The   ﬁrst   few   lines   of the   ﬁle   are   as   shown in ﬁgure 1.   The Origin denotes the country   or   region   of   origin   of the   bananas.    TheFigure   1:   The ﬁrst few lines of the   bananas.csv ﬁle.Date   header shows the date and the Price   column the cost in pounds sterling for a kilogram   of bananas.   You will notice that there are entries with the country of origin as   ‘all   bananas’   which is an average of the collective data   for   that   date.
You need to process the ﬁle using MATLAB to answer the following   questions:
1.   From   the   data   produce a   list   of   the   distinct   entries   under   the Origin   header (for   example   something like
columbia costa 
rica 
honduras 
panama 
guatamala 
for the sample in   Figure   1).
2.   Banana prices fluctuate a lot during the year.   From   which   region   is   the   average   price   lowest, and for which region is   the   average   price   highest.   The   average   here   is   deﬁned   as the mean of the prices taken over the data   for   that   region.
3.   Produce a boxplot comparing the variation of the prices   of bananas   with   countries   of   origin ‘colombia’,   ‘costa rica’,   ‘honduras’,   ‘windward isles’   and ‘all   bananas’, and com-   ment on your results.
4.   Produce a time series plot showing the   variation   of   the   prices   of   bananas   with countries   of origin   ’colombia’   .   Analyze the time series and comment on any seasonal trends.
5.   Use the MATLAB corrcoef   function to calculate the correlation coefficient between the fluctuation of   ’columbia’   and   ’ecuador’ prices and comment on your results.Outputs required You   are   required to   submit   a report   (maximum   8 pages   including   any appendices) in pdf form. via the   Turnitin   submission   box   on   Blackboard.    Additionally   you need to submit your m-ﬁles or mlx-ﬁles used for the MATLAB codes via   the Blackboard   Submission Box also on   Blackboard.
Additional information and guidelines 
1.   All   coding   must   be   done   in   MATLAB.
2.   Keep to the page length not exceeding eight A4 pages, and there   is   no   need   for   a   title   page or   abstract for   a relative short   report   like   this.    Font   sizes   should   be   no   smaller   than   11 point, and page margins no   smaller   than   2cm.
3.   List the complete code of the whole function at the end of each   question,   or   in   an   ap-   pendix.   Make your source code more readable, by keeping   the indentation and stylistic   features, and it can be copied from your   submitted work.   Codes   submitted   should   be   the same   as those in the   report.    Your published   results   should   be   reproducible   from   the code   attached.
4.   Have a look at the generic rubric abo代 写MATH36031 Project 3Python
代做程序编程语言ut how   your   report   will   be   marked,   and   also   the   intended learning outcomes about what you are expected to   achieve   in the   end.
5.   Avoid copying   (too many) sentences directly from the   project   description,   and   try   to   restate the problem with your own words or examples if possible.
6.   You may use your report in the future   as   evidences   of   written   work,   so   take   it   seriously.
7.   Your target audience is a fellow student on your course:   explain the   questions   so   that   the report can be understood without this project   description   and   your   approach   could   be implemented in another computer language like Python.   The report   should   indicate   to the reader how well you understand the problem and the   approach you   took.   Your   goal   will   be   to   communicate   your   solutions   to   another   person   rather   than   to   show   you’ve completed the assignment.
8.   Balance the explanation of the approach and the comments in the code.   Avoid under-   commenting and over-commenting.
9.   Aim for precision and clarity of writing.
10.   Since there is no ﬁnal exam, you are advised   to spend   at   least 15 hours   on   each   project,   with additional self-study if you are less experience with computer programming.   Re-   member for a   10 credit module   like   this   one,   you   are   expect   to   spend   100   =   10   ×    10   hours in total   (including lectures, labs, self-study and coursework).
11.   Please   do   not   put   any   personal   information   on   the   report, only   your   student   ID   number.
12.   The   submission   for   each   project   will   be   open   two   weeks   before   the   deadline.    Only   your   last   submission will be   marked,   and   anything   submitted   after the   deadline   will   be treated late   and   any penalty   will   be   applied   by   the   Teaching   and   Learning   O伍ce   in June according to the Undergraduate Student   Handbook.
13.   Whilst   this   project   can   be   done   without   the   use   of   any   artiﬁcial   intelligence   (AI)   software   tools, if you use any AI tools or software to help you with your project, you must mention this in the report.    Please study the guidelines at https://manchester-uk.libanswers.com/teaching-and-learning/faq/264824 on how to do this correctly. The content and accuracy of the report will be your responsibility alone, and any factually incorrect statements or mathematically incorrect content will be penalised. 
14.   Your attention is also drawn to to the University’s   Academic Malpractice Policy,   see https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=639.   See   also   the   guide-   lines on the use of AI via the course on Academic   Integrity   at: https://www.education.library.manchester.ac.uk/mle/academic-integrity/ 
15.   We   are   obliged   to   report   cases   of   suspected   academic   malpractice,   and   people   may   be   subject   to   an   additional   oral   assessment   on   the   content   of the   report   and   codes   submitted.
